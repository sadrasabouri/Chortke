# Chortke
Chortke is a scientific calculator giving you the opportunity to facilitate your calculations and studies.

This is a project done by three undergraduate students at Sharif University of Technology.
## Compile
In order to compile "Chortke" you can simply run this command in your terminal :
```
gcc -o Chortke Chortke.c Processing.c Stack.c UI.c -lm
```
## Samples
Feel free in using Chortke, you can easily calculate any equation using ( , ) , + , - , ! , ^ , * , / , exp , ln , sin , cos , tan , cot , abs and so on.
Here you are some samples for using Chortke:
```
= 2 + 2
``` 
Result is : 4.000000
```
= (5 + 3) / 5.6
```
Result is : 1.428571
```
= (5*(9.2/2-(5+6)))/(-6)
```
Result is : 5.333333
```
= sin(pi/2)
```
Result is : 1.000000
```
= sin(ln(sin(pi/4)))
```
Result is : -0.339677
```
= (sin(pi/4))^2 + (cos(pi/4))^2
```
Result is : 1.000000
* Note using parentheses when using none linear equations.
